''' AC changes in both magnitude and direction.
Z = Impedance : Measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when
a voltage is applied.

AC
==
V = I*Z
I = V/Z
Z = V/I

Resistors will be represented as real numbers, while capacitors and inductors will be represented as imaginary.

T = Period : Time required to produce one complete cycle of a waveform.

Cycle is one complete positive & negative alternation of the waveform. 

F = Frequency : The number of cycles per second. Measured in hertz (Hz).

F = 1 / T

T = 1 / F

120Vrms @ 60Hz. 
Period = 1/60 

Vp = 0 to max positive peak on sin wave.

Vrms = .707 * Vp
